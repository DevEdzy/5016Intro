def main():
    print("Hello World!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

print("Guru99")

# Guru99 is printed in this case.

# Here is the explanation,

# When Python interpreter reads a source file, it will execute all the code found in it.
# When Python runs the “source file” as the main program, it sets the special variable (__name__) to have a value (“__main__”).
# When you execute the main function in python, it will then read the “if” statement and checks whether __name__ does equal to __main__.
# In Python “if__name__== “__main__” allows you to run the Python files either as reusable modules or standalone programs.'''
