Hi my name is Michael Edwards

I am an aspiring Web Developer

Currently studying a Diploma in Web Development and Design with Whitecliffe

This repository was created for my IT5016D Software Development Fundamentals class

It contains mostly practice exercises, problems/code I am stuck on and projects I am interested in

Please feel free to leave any comments on how I can improve my programming skills
